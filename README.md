# Energy Project Name Generator

## Background
This project is a web application for generating energy project names based on user input. It is designed to help professionals in the oil, gas, and renewable energy sectors create unique and relevant names for their projects. The project is based on the OpenAI Platform Quickstart Guide but has been adapted to suit the specific needs of this application.
